			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
				<p>Wilson’s BBQ is a small family owned restaurant located in Fairfield, CT. Over the past couple years the restaurant has gained quite a reputation for it’s delicious bbq. It has also caught the eye of some big names in the restaurant business, such as Guy Fieri. It has also been featured on both of Guy’s shows, Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives and Guy’s Big Bite. Unfortunately, when you look the the Wilson’s BBQ website, it does not reflect the success of the business or what it is like to eat at this charming restaurant. The plan is to revamp the website to be more usability,  give it an updated, attractive design, and make it more mobile friendly. </p>
				<p>Currently, the current Wilson’s BBQ website’s main goals are to inform customers/ potential customers of the restaurant location, hours, menu offerings, and catering options, and give the viewer an idea of the experience of dining at their restaurant. The current site is successful in informing the viewer of the hours and location. They are the first thing you see on the site. There is a page to view the menu but it is executed poorly. The formating is difficult to read. The description also uses “SOS” to describe sauce on the side, which is not typically known to those who are not in the restaurant industry.  There are tabs to view side options, drinks, and desserts, but they are poorly located on the bottom of the page. Also the Desserts tab is a broken link.  There is also a broken image on the menu page. </p>
				<p>My main goal of wilsons-bbq.com is for it to reflect what it is truely like to eat at this one-of-a kind barbeque joint. I believe that if the website reflects more of the Wilson’s BBQ experience it will help increase business by enticing new customers. I also want to focus on making the site responsive so it is friendlier for those viewing on smaller screens and mobile devices. I want to keep the location and hours prominent and make getting directions easily accessible to those on mobile phones. Usability is also a high priority since this site attracts all types of users so I want to make sure it is easy to navigate for those who are not as computer literate. </p>

			<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
				<h3><a href="http://www.dinosaurbarbque.com/">Dinosaur Bar-B-Que</a> (Page Rank: 273,212)</h3>
				<p>Dinosaur Bar-B-Que has quite a nice site and some great statistics. The first thing I notice on their site is the delicious rack of ribs. People eat with their eyes first so this is a great way to entice new customers. A great picture of the food is something I would like the include in the new Wilson’s BBQ site. I am planning on pulling some of the food pictures off their Facebook page  and tweaking them in Photoshop. The next great thing about this site is that it is easy to navigate. It also has a mobile site. The demographic that uses the site most is females, between the ages 35-44, and are college education. The Average time on site is 1:51-1:59 minutes with is less time spent on site than wilsons-bbq.com. I suspect that is because the site is easier to navigate. </p>
				<h3><a href="http://thecookhouse.com/">The Cookhouse</a> (Page Rank: 6,823,016)</h3>
				<p>The website statistics from Alexa.com provided little information. The website has a worse Global Ranking than Wilson’s BBQ. Statistically that site is performing no better than Wilson’s BBQ but when looking over the site there are some areas that they are doing more successfully. First and foremost they have a working mobile website. They also have specials listed on the homepage with entices customers. There navigation is also better organized and they have more pictures of their food. There is not demographic information accessible for The Cookhouse and they are not tapping into any keywords that would be useful to Wilson’s BBQ. </p>
				<h3><a href="http://bobbyqsrestaurant.com/">Bobby Q’s Bodacious BBQ and Grill</a> (Page Rank: 5,721,726)</h3>
				<p>Surprisingly, when I look for site data on Bobby Q’s there is little to none. The website is quite nice and the best aesthetically out of all the other competitors. One of the main things that stands out on this site is the trust symbols on the right hand side of the the homepage. There is also a list of specials and events that is easy to view and above the fold. They also feature some great pictures of the restaurant and food to give potential guests an idea of the Bobby Q’s experience. There are a couple things that Bobby Q’s can improve on. First there is no mobile website. Also, all the pictures are built with Flash slideshows which are also not viewable on a mobile device. The hours are on the first page but are not very prominent. The menu page has an attractive easy to read design but it is one large image, which search engines cannot crawl.

			<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
				<p>Emma is a 27 year old female who is planning on eating at Wilson’s BBQ for dinner tonight. She gets lost looking for the restaurant and needs directions. She pulls over and looks up the website on her phone. She needs quick easy directions so the site needs to be easy to use on her cellphone. The address needs to be in text so she can copy and paste it into her cell phone's GPS. </p>
				<p>Brady and Jenny are a 41 and 42 year old married couple. They are looking for a place to have a date night out. They want to try something new so they Google “Fairfield restaurants” and find Wilson’s BBQ. They want to see the menu, some pictures of the food, and see how close it is to their house, and the hours. They don’t want to take to much time looking for a place to eat so they need to get the majority of the information from the homepage. </p>
